One day has passed. Only thirty more left.
Another day has passed. I can feel it nearing.
With each day comes both fear and excitement.
Why am I afraid of my birthday? Well, let me explain.

It all started on my 12th birthday.
I got out of bed and crept down the stairs.
To my surprise, nobody was home.
Then I saw the family cat, sitting directly in front of the door.
To my even greater surprise, the cat said "wondering where everyone is, aren't you? Why don't you look outside..."
